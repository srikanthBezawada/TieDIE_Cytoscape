## For users interested in TieDIE app. for Cytoscape
*Stay tuned*



## For developers interested in TieDIE app. for Cytoscape (How to set up Netbeans IDE)
1. Install Netbeans from here [1] Java SE 90 MB one should do.
2. Once installed ,Go to  File-> Open Project and this dialog appears like here [2]. 
3. You just have to select our TieDIE maven project which should be already downloaded on your computer in advance from here [3].
4. Cytoscape javadocs are available here [4].
5. More references for Cytoscape app. development [5].
6. Cytoscape app. cookbook [6]
7. Once you are done with developing the project, you can clean and build the project and you'll find a jar file in the target folder. This jar file is used to install TieDIE app. through Cytoscape. You should download Cytoscape 3.x from here [7].

## About this project

=======
TieDIE  algorithm [t1] finds "subnetworks" connecting genomic perturbations to transcriptional changes in large gene interaction networks. This algorithm is useful in optimizing cancer treatment by viewing cancer from a gene network perspective thus enhancing our understanding of disease initiation, progression and therapy. This project deploys TieDIE algorithm into cytoscape as an app. 

This is a GSOC 2014 project developed by Srikanth.B under the supervision of Evan Paull.
